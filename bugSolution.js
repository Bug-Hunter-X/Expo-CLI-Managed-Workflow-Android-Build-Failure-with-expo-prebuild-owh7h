The solution often involves carefully reviewing the project's dependencies and Android-specific configurations.  In some cases, it might be necessary to completely clean the project's build files and rebuild from scratch.  Updating Expo's SDK version or specific packages may also resolve the issue.  Examining the build logs closely, even though they're unspecific, can sometimes provide clues.

Here's an example of checking package versions and cleaning the build:

```javascript
npm outdated  //check for outdated packages
npm install //install updated packages
expo prebuild --clean //force clean and rebuild
```

Sometimes, there is no obvious fix, and the only workaround is to resort to the bare workflow to have more control over the Android build process.
